# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
The project is conducted on the breast cancer dataset from UCI Machine Learning Database. The goal of this project is to build a classification model to classify the diagnosis (malignant or benign) of the tumor based on the other 30 attributes such as radius_mean and texture_mean. The project will apply decision tree technique to build the model.
